# Encrypt the vault file:


ansible-vault encrypt vault_aws_creds.yml


Replace "your_aws_access_key", "your_aws_secret_key", and other placeholder values with your actual AWS credentials and configuration.


Run the playbook:


ansible-playbook -i localhost, --ask-vault-pass aws_infrastructure_management.yml



This example showcases how Ansible can be used to manage AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances, security groups, and load balancers, and deploy a Java application. Adjust the variables and tasks based on your specific AWS setup and application requirements.
