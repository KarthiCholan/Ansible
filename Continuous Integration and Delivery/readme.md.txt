To encrypt sensitive information using Ansible Vault:

bash
Copy code
ansible-vault encrypt_string --name 'vault_tomcat_password' 'your_tomcat_password'
Replace 'your_tomcat_password' with your actual Tomcat password.

In this example:

The playbook builds the Java application using a custom build script.
Runs unit tests and integration tests using a custom test script.
Deploys the application to the testing environment and restarts Tomcat.
Runs acceptance tests (you need to replace this task with the actual commands for your acceptance tests).
Deploys the application to the production environment and restarts Tomcat.
You can run this playbook using the ansible-playbook command:

bash
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini --ask-vault-pass ci_cd_pipeline.yml
Replace ci_cd_server with the group of servers you want to include in your CI/CD pipeline in your inventory file. Adjust the paths, configurations, and deployment steps based on your specific build and deployment process.
